Repo containing jupyter notebooks for my undergrad econometric projects. 

Project1:
A report analyzing a dataset tracking the wages of Swedish individuals born in either '48 or '53 as well as their various characteristics. Those born in '53 were subject to an extended educational program. The key questions which this report aims to answer are:
What are the returns to education and how do they differ by gender? 
How is the time/age profile of earnings shaped by education?
What are the differences between men and women in educational attainment and career profiles of earnings and how does the gender gap change with age?
What is the role of ability in shaping the returns to education? Does this differ by gender

Project2:
A report analyzing the effects of formal technical training intervention on wage outcomes. The paper displays the positive and long-term effects that training intervention can have in a developing society, particularly in boosting formal employment.
